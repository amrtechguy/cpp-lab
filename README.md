# C++ Lab
It's a place where I test and build basic solutions for my ideas in C++.
All projects in this repository aren't fully tested, they're just drafts for project ideas.
Once a project gets bigger, I'll create a separate repository for it.

## Projects
All projects will be listed here ordered from oldest to latest.
