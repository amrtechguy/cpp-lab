# C++ Lab
It's a place where I test and build basic solutions for my ideas in C++.
All projects in this repository aren't fully tested, they're just drafts for project ideas.
Once a project gets bigger, I'll create a separate repository for it.

## Projects
All projects will be listed here ordered from oldest to latest.

### [0] CSV library
It handles CSV files including searching, adding, updating, and deleting from them.

### [1] Write less
A fast way to generate text blocks using shortcuts that you provide.

### [2] File Handler
A reference for me on how to handle files in C++
